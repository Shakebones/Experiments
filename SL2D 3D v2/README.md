Semi-Lagrangian-Smoke-Simulation
================================

My implementation of a Semi-Lagrangian fluid simulator as it applies to smoke. This simulation accounts for the advection of air velocity, smoke density, and temperature. It also accounts solves the Poisson equation for pressure and includes an implementation of both buoyancy and vorticity confinement forces as described by Bridson's 2007 SIGGRAPH notes.
