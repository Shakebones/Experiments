Here is my submission for HW03, Fluid Simulation. It should build without error in Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 as it does on my personal machine. 

I have implemented all of the required features of the project successfully, and a video of my results -- titled SmokeSimulation_movie -- can be found in the zipped project submission folder. And while I wasn't able to get to any of the extra credit features, I hope to continue with this project on my own and flesh it out further.

Finally, here are my responses to the required questions:

1. Lagrangian fluid systems follows individual fluid particles along their trajectories, while Eulerian fluid systems rely on a regular grid in space where the values of system variables are observed at fixed points in space at each time step. This approach is known as semi-lagrangian because it relies on a regular Eulerian grid for the spatial observations, but draws the discrete equations (i.e. advection, pressure, divergence, etc.) from a Lagrangian approach.

2. Both smoke and liquid water can be simulated with either Eulerian or Lagrangian systems (or, in our case, semi-Lagrangian). They both lend themselves to particle dynamics and contiuous flow, which would make both approaches valid. Both are also advected similarly and maintain the same properties (i.e. density, temperature, etc.). However, while it is true that both smoke and water can be modeled with similar fluid systems, there are several differences. In water and other liquids, the advected particles need to be rendered by finding the bounding mesh volume, since water has surface tension properties and maintains a smooth boundary with the air layer. Furthermore, the two fluid types have different external forces applied to them because of the varying phase states. Smoke, which for all intents and purposes acts like a gas, is affected by buoyancy and viscosity confinement forces in our system, while water would be alternately affected by viscosity and, again, surface tension forces.

3. Using a grid according to an Eulerian spatial approach offers several advantages, one of which is that it automatically generates smooth fluid surfaces because of its spatial discretization. It also inherently offers incompressibility. Unfortunately, advection becomes more complicated and less exact. Because we are observing fluid flow past fixed points in space, we need to account for an extra advection term in the Navier-Stokes equations that is not present in Lagrangian viewpoints. This is one of the other simulation techniques: Lagrangian simulation. This method instead follows the particles, making advection simple. Because of this, it lends itself to splashes/droplets and more complex interactions with objects. Unfortunately, smooth surface generation and incompressibility become harder in Lagrangian fluid advection schemes. Another type of fluid simulating technique is the Lattice-Boltzmann method. LBM models the fluid consisting of fictive particles, which perform consecutive propogation and collision processes over a discrete lattice mesh. The advantages of this method include parallelization of the simulation and greater ability to deal with complex boundaries than more traditional methods. Unfortunately, there are limitations, one of which is the absence of a consistent thermo-hydrodynamic scheme. (LBM information source: Wikipedia)

4. According to Bridson's notes, "Level sets are attractive for water simulation since they can very easily model smooth surfaces (unlike marker particles) while still trivially handling topology changes (unlike meshes, in which surface topology changes are not trivial at all), and further easily provide information such as whether a point ~x is inside the ?uid: we simply interpolate phi at ~x from nearby grid points and check if the sign is negative." However, Bridson also points out the drawbacks of the level set method. Unlike mesh topology, level set methods tend to eliminate features on the scale of one grid cell or smaller.
